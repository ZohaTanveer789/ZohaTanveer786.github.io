            <h6>Personal Portfolio Website</h6>
            <p><strong>Project Overview</strong> <br>This is a personal portfolio website that I built and deployed using GitHub Pages.
               The purpose of this project is to create an online presence that showcases who I am, what I'm learning.
             It acts as my digital resume — easily shareable with recruiters, employers, or collaborators.</p>
             <br>
            <p><strong>About the Website</strong><br>The site introduces me and highlights my skills, educational background, and development interests. It also includes links to my projects, a downloadable resume, and a contact section to connect with visitors. You can navigate between pages like Home, About, Projects, and Contact Me using the navbar.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Key Features</strong><br>
             Clean, Responsive Design — Optimized for readability and ease of use.<br>
             Skills Section — Shows web development skills and tools you're familiar with.<br>
             Resume Download — Link to download a professional resume.<br>
             Navigation Menu — Easy one-click access to different sections.</p>
