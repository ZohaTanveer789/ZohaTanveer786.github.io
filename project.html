        <h6>Personal Portfolio Website</h6>
        <p><strong>Project Overview</strong> <br>This is a personal portfolio website that I built and deployed using GitHub Pages.
           The purpose of this project is to create an online presence that showcases who I am, what I'm learning,
         . It acts as my digital resume — easily shareable with recruiters, employers, or collaborators.
          <br><strong>About the Website</strong><br>The site introduces me and highlights my skills, educational background, and development interests. It also includes links to my projects, a downloadable resume, and a contact section to connect with visitors. You can navigate between pages like Home, About, Projects, and Contact Me using the navbar.
        <br><strong>Key Features</strong><br>Clean, Responsive Design — Optimized for readability and ease of use.
        Skills Section — Shows web development skills and tools you're familiar with. 




Resume Download — Link to download a professional resume. 
Navigation Menu — Easy one-click access to different sections. </p>
