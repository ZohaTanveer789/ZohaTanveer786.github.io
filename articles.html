            <h6><strong>How I built my portfolio from scratch using HTML & CSS</strong></h6>
            <p>I didn’t start with a No React. No Tailwind. No “modern stack.”Just plain HTML and CSS — on purpose.
            I wanted to understand what I was doing, not just assemble components like IKEA furniture and hope nothing collapses 
            later. This portfolio wasn’t about flexing. It was about learning in public and proving to myself that I can build 
            from the ground up.
        </p>
            <p><strong>Why I Chose the Harder Way</strong><br>When you’re starting out, it’s tempting to jump 
                straight into shiny tools. Everyone online makes it look like if you’re not using the latest 
                framework, you’re already behind.I didn’t buy that.HTML and CSS are the bones of the web. If 
                I can’t control layout, spacing, responsiveness, and structure without a library holding my hand, then I don’t 
                really know web development — I’m just borrowing it.So I stripped it down.No shortcuts. 
                No copy-paste templates. Just fundamentals.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Turning Ideas Into Structure</strong><br>I started by deciding what the site should say before
             worrying about how it should look.I broke it into simple sections:Home,About,Skills,Projects,Contact.
             HTML gave me the structure — headings, sections, links. Nothing fancy. But getting the hierarchy right 
             mattered more than visuals at this stage. If the structure is messy, styling won’t save you.
             Once the skeleton felt solid, I moved to CSS.
        </p>
        <p><strong>CSS: Where Things Got Real</strong><br>This is where reality hit.Flexbox humbled me.Margins didn’t behave.
        Things refused to center even when they were “technically” centered.I spent more time fixing alignment than
        actually designing — and honestly, that’s where most of the learning happened.

        I learned: <ul>

        <li>why spacing consistency matters</li>

        <li>how flexbox actually thinks</li>

        <li>how small padding changes can completely change the feel of a page</li>
        </ul>

        Every bug forced me to slow down and ask why instead of just Googling a fix and moving on.
        </p>
       <p><strong>The Part Nobody Talks About: Breaking Things</strong><br>I broke the site more times than I can 
        count.Text overlapped images.Navbars acted possessed.One CSS rule ruined three other sections.But each break 
        taught me something tutorials never do: how code behaves when it’s wrong.That trial-and-error loop — break
        → debug → understand — is where real confidence comes from.
        </p>
        <p><strong>What I’d Do Differently Next Time</strong>This wasn’t perfect, and that’s fine.
        <ul>
        If I were to rebuild it:
        <li>I’d plan responsiveness earlier instead of fixing it later</li>
        <li> I’d comment my CSS more clearly.</li>
        <li>I’d be more intentional with color variables</li>
        </ul>
        But I wouldn’t change the decision to start simple.Because now, when I do move to frameworks, I’ll know what
        they’re abstracting — and what they’re hiding.
        </p>
<p><strong>Why This Portfolio Matters to Me</strong><br>This website isn’t just a showcase.
It’s a checkpoint.

It proves I can start with nothing and build something functional, readable, and mine. It shows my thinking, my learning curve, and my willingness to struggle instead of skipping steps.

I’m still learning. Still early. Still experimenting.

But this portfolio?
It’s real progress — not vibes.</p>
<p><strong>Final Thought</strong>If you’re starting out, don’t rush to look advanced.
Build something simple and understand it deeply.

The confidence you get from that?
Unmatched.</p>
