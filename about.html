 <h2>About Me</h2>
 <p>
 I'm a curious mind with a thing for building ideas into reality. 
 Currently diving into AI and computer science, I enjoy mixing logic with creativity to make things that work and look good doing it. 
 From coding late at night to learning new tools just because they exist, I believe growth comes from experimenting, failing fast, and trying again.
 I'm not here to follow the crowd, I'm here to learn deeply, build boldly, and keep leveling up.

 <h1>My Journey</h1>
 <div class="main-container-journey">
 <div class="about-card" style="background-color:#DBC2A6;">
 <p >   My journey didn't start with a master plan. I started by breaking things, fixing them,
 and asking 'why' a lot. <br>I grew up as a quiet, observant kid. I spoke less and noticed more — learning by watching patterns, listening carefully, and understanding things before reacting to them. Curiosity was always there, even when I couldn't clearly name what I wanted to do with. <br>
 As I moved through school, that uncertainty became more real. Unsure about my exact path, I chose pre-medical, hoping clarity would come with time. Instead, it taught me something important: while medicine interested me, I was more drawn to the problem-solving, logic, and technology. <br> Behind 
 That realization slowly pulled me toward the AI side of medical sciences — where data, algorithms, and technology meet real human impact. Understanding that connection helped things finally make sense.<br>
 The academic road wasn't smooth. Getting the required scores to enter Punjab University came with pressure and doubt, and there were moments when I wasn't sure I'd make it. But persistence mattered more than certainty, and eventually that effort paid off.
 <br>Now, as a first-semester student at Punjab University, I'm building my foundation in programming, digital logic, and web development — skills that align with my long-term interest in applying AI to healthcare. I'm early in the journey, learning patiently, improving steadily, and trusting the process. 
 I don't have everything figured out yet — but I've found the direction that fits me, and that's enough to keep moving forward.  <br>
     I am still writing my story, but I now have the clarity and tools to make every chapter count.
